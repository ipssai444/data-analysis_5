Step 1 – Understanding the Task
The objective of this task was to perform data analysis on an air quality dataset containing daily pollution measurements such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, Ozone, and AQI values. The dataset also had temporal features (Date, Month, Year, Days) and holiday information. The main goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize this data to understand trends and patterns.

Step 2 – Setting up the Project
Created a project folder named data-analysis inside the DAY 5 directory. Opened PowerShell in the project folder location. Created a virtual environment named data-analysis using:
python -m venv data-analysis
Activated the virtual environment:
.\data-analysis\Scripts\activate

Step 3 – Installing Required Libraries
Installed the necessary Python libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Step 4 – Preparing the Dataset
Downloaded the air quality dataset (air_quality.csv) and placed it inside the project folder.
The dataset contained:
Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, Ozone
Time Data: Date, Month, Year, Days (as numeric representation)
Holiday Data: 1 = Holiday, 0 = Working day
Target Variable: AQI (Air Quality Index)

Step 5 – Writing the Analysis Script (analysis.py)
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Displayed the first 5 rows to verify correct loading.
Checked dataset information (df.info()), missing values, and summary statistics.
Created visualizations to show trends and distributions:

Line Plot – AQI over time.

Box Plots – Distribution of AQI per month.

Heatmap – Correlation between pollutants and AQI.
Saved all plots as PNG files in the project folder instead of showing them (to avoid Tkinter errors).

Step 6 – Running the Analysis
Ran the script using:
python analysis.py
Verified that the script executed successfully and saved plots in PNG format.
Confirmed the analysis output in the terminal, showing dataset details, missing values report, and summary statistics.
